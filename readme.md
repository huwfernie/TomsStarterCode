Hey Tom,

Here is the starter code that you can use either as a guide to build your own, or just to modify to get a headstart on the website you want to build.

the stack is:

Node backend;
Express for the views
MongoDB is the database

You'll need to install a few things to get it going, not sure what actually! from the TomsStarterCode folder, in terminal, run "npm install", and see if it says anything.

You'll need a version of MongoDB installed on your computer. Then in terminal get it running "mongod"

Then you need to run your virtual server, so in terminal run "gulp", once everything is installed then you should be able to go to http://localhost:3000/ and see the homepage, login and register pages. that's all there is at the moment.

remember to write the SASS in the src folder, not the public one.
